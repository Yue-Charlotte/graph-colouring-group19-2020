# graph-colouring-group19_2020

Project 1-1 
Graph coloring project - Group 19

- "Phase3" folder contains all of our coding files
- "Phase3TournamentVersion" contains all code used for the tournament version of our program
- Group19.jar is our executable version

To run the "Phase3" code, compile it with "javac P3.java" and then do "java P3 <graph text file>".

To run the "Phase3TournamentVersion" code, compile it with "javac Phase3TournamentVersion.java" and then do "java Phase3TournamentVersion <graph text file>".
Phase3TournamentVersion is the exact same code as our "Group19.jar" file, so this is the same as running the jar file with "java -jar Group19.jar <graph text file>".
